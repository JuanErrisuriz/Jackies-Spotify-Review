    I really like this song, the beat and the lyrics really make me feel a certain type of way. The song tells a story that I really like and I feel like
    its something I may be going through, anyways... Its a really good song and I enjoyed it. Added to planet vibe. 9/10

    This song sounds familiar, but it feels new. The beat is something I like aswell as the lyrics. OHH... the end is what i've heard. Yeah the ending 
    really makes the song for me. Its a good song, something I may listen to when im feeling down. Added to planet vibe. 9/10

<div><h3> Strawberry Skies </h3>
<p>
I've heard this one before, actually I've had this one in my playlist. The song is good and the chorus and melody are executed perfectly. The beat is what really
draws me in, its really catchy as well. 10/10

<div><h3>Magic In The Hamptons</h3>
<p>
I havent listened to Lil Yachty in years, but I really enjoyed this song. I really like the chorus its super catchy and its my 
favorite part of the song. The beat and the clapping also make the song really enjoyable. Feels like something thats from 2017. Overall I like the 
song. Added to planet vibe. 10/10
</p></div>
<div><h3> White Walls</h3>
<p>
    I like Macklemore a lot, though im not sure ive heard this song. OHH... nevermind, ive heard this one a long time ago. I like the song, I feel like Hollis really
    carries the song with her parts. really solid song. Added to 2015 drive. 8/10
