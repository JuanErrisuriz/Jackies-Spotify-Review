<div><h3> California Love</h3>
<p>
Okay so ive heard this song a lot already, and while I like 2Pac, I feel like this song has been used so much in movies and stuff like that. When I hear it
im kinda like, "Oh, its this song again". But its a good song and the beat is kinda iconic, classic Dr.Dre. 7/10
</p></div>
<div><h3> Colors and Shapes</h3>
<p>
ALRIGHT ANOTHER ONE, It has a slow start for sure, but it lets you vibe to the beat a little. Hes really going for this really calm vibe. This is a song I could listen to

</p></div>
<div><h3> So This Is Love </h3>

<div><h3> Fabolous</h3>
<p>
I really like the beat on this one, makes me wanna....WHOA HOLD ON, TF ARE THE LYRICS, oh nvm I thought he said sum else LMAO. Anyways, the beat makes
me wanna just space out to it. For some reason it gives me Japanese/Samurai vibes,and im here for it. Pretty good, added to planet vibe. 9/10
</p></div>
<div><h3> Coca Butter Kisses</h3>
<p>
I havent heard a lot of Chance The Rapper so this is fairly new to me. First impressions, the beat reminds me of another song I like, but I forget what its called.
The lyrics are kinda buttery and sound good. I like the chorus, its catchy and Twista's part was clean. 9/10
</p></div>
<div><h3> Destroy Myself Just For You</h3>
<p>
I feel like ive heard this song before, it sounds familiar. But it gives me this really nice feeling, like hope? IDK... it changes at the end and kind ruins it
in my opinion. Not bad tho, 7/10
</p></div>
<div><h3> Last Year</h3>
<p>
This gives me last day of summer vibes, its this hopeful but kind of a sad song. The story it tells is relatable, the beat gives me this 90's feeling. 
I like this one, adding to my vibe playlist. 8/10
</p></div>
<div><h3> If I Dont Go To Hell</h3>

myself listening to. Its a good song, added to my 2015 drive. 8/10
</p></div>

and his part is good. Nice song, 8/10
</p></div>
<div><h3> Just Can't Get Enough</h3>
<p>
I dont know why but this song remindes me of Major Lazar. I find the song enjoyable but its not something I would listen to everday. I like the beat and the 
lyrics but I dont really know why I wouldnt listen to it over and over. Anyways, good song. 8/10
</p></div>
<div><h3>Summertime in Paris</h3>
<p>
I actually have listened to Jaden....OH SHII, THIS IS WHERE THIS COMES FROM? Back to the topic at hand, I like his music, ive never listened to

</p></div>
<div><h3> La Llorona</h3>
    <p>
The beat is really nice and the lyrics are really smooth. I could listen to this song on repeat. I think it sounds kinda sad, I think thats what I like about it so much.
